    // Introduction to Classic Physics

    // Everything in universe operates on centain principles.
    // Principles can be known, understood, and described
    // using mathematics.
    // For example, if we throw a an object form a tall building,
    // mathematics can tell us what will happen.
    // Like, how fast the ball will drop, where it'll be hit.
    // This means the motion of every object in the universe ins't
    // random, but quantomfiable, calculable, and predictable.
    // Wheather we're talking about a pebble or a galaxy.

    // The universe is math.

    // Classicle physics doesn't work for the object that are:
    // very small, or moving very fast, like speed of light.

    // But we now know a lot about these things as well.
    // Which is called "Modern Physics".

    // We can understand "Modern Physics" after we understand
    // Classical Physics. Since classical physics came first.
