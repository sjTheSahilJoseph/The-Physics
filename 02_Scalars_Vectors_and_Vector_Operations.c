	// Before learning physics, we must have to know basics of language of physics.
	// Like what are the units of measurements, how do we write things, and read things, etc...

	// Like scientific notation, to denote very small, or very large numbers.
	// and Dimensional Anaylsis.
	// Beyond these basics, one more thing is scalars, vectors and their operations.

	// Scalars convey particular size or magnitude.
	// Like, mass of a book, the amount of time, the temperature, etc...
	// These are numerical quantities along with any relevant units.
	// That simply answer the question: "How much".

	// Vector
	// Vector has not only the magnitude but also the direction.
	// It answers both: "how much?" and "which way?".
	// Forces are drawn as vectors.

	// To denote a vector, we use letters in bold fonts with an arrow on top.


	// Vector Operations.

	// If we want to add 2 vectors:
	/*
	  We simply start the second vector where the first vector ends.
	  And then create a new resultant vector.
	  That goes from the start of the first to end of the second.

	  // Vectors must retain their direction when added.

	  If the vectors pointing in the same direction.
	  There some will be a longer vector.
	  We just sum them. Like addition.

	  When there is an angle between 2 vectors.

	  When we draw a resultant vector, it'll be the hypotenuse of the right triangle.

	  And that hypotenuse must be less than the sum of vectors.

	  This can be found by "Pythagorean Theoram".
	  a^2 + b^2 = c^2

	  int a = 4;
	  int b = 3;
	  int c = 5;
